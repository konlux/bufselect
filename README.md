# bufselect
vim plugin to easy select an open buffer

It's simply the buffers output from which you can select a file by hitting up and down with "J"/"K" and hit "Enter" to load tat file/buffer in the current window.
There is also a very good plugin, called bufexplorer, which does nearly the same and much above that.
This is a quit simpler approach.
